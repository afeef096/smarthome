This home security system project utilizes an Arduino 
Uno to create a simple, yet effective security solution. 
It integrates various components such as an RFID 
module for arming/disarming, an HC-05 Bluetooth 
module for remote control, a 16x2 LCD to display 
system status, LEDs for visual indicators, and a buzzer 
to alert of unauthorized access. The system arms or 
disarms based on RFID card authentication or 
Bluetooth commands, while providing real-time status 
updates on the LCD. In the event of an intrusion, the 
buzzer sounds, and the red LED lights up. The system 
can be expanded with additional features like motion 
sensors, GSM alerts, and Wi-Fi integration for advanced 
monitoring and control. 

**Objective:** 
The objective of this project is to design a simple yet 
effective home security system that utilizes an Arduino 
Uno as the central controller. The system integrates 
multiple components, including an RFID module, 
Bluetooth (HC-05), LEDs, Buzzer, and a 16x2 LCD, to 
provide real-time security features such as 
arming/disarming, unauthorized access detection, and 
status monitoring.

**Components**
1.Arduino Uno
2.RFID module(RC522)
3.HC-05 Bluetooth module
4.16x2 LCD Display with I2C 
5. LEDs (Green and Red) 
6. Mini 5V Buzzer
7.Breadboar & Jumper Wires

**Key Learnings **
1. RFID Integration: Understanding how to interface the 
RFID module with the Arduino to enable secure user 
authentication for arming/disarming the system. 
2. Bluetooth Communication: Gaining experience in 
controlling devices remotely through Bluetooth, which 
can be useful for remote security monitoring. 
3. LCD and I2C Protocol: Learning how to use an I2C 
LCD display to present real-time data and status 
updates, which improves user interaction with the 
system. 
4. Basic Security System Design: Designing a basic 
security system that combines multiple components 
and integrates them for a comprehensive solution. 
5. Troubleshooting and Debugging: Dealing with wiring 
issues, software bugs, and ensuring proper 
communication between components such as the RFID, 
Bluetooth, and LCD.

This project provides a foundation for more complex 
home security systems and offers valuable insights into 
working with various hardware and protocols.
